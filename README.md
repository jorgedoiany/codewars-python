# Codewars Solutions Repository

This repository contains all the Python solutions I've developed for coding challenges from the [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/dashboard) platform. Every day, I tackle new problems that test my **Python programming and problem-solving skills**, and here I've compiled my implementations and approaches to those challenges.

## What is it about?
Codewars is a platform where programmers can improve their skills by solving coding problems (known as `katas`) that range from beginner to advanced levels. In this repository, you'll find my **Python solutions** to these problems, each:
âœ” **Organized** by difficulty level (8kyu to 1kyu)
âœ” **Commented** for clear understanding
âœ” **Optimized** for efficiency when possible

## What is it for?
This repository serves as:

- A **progress tracker** of my Python coding journey
- A **learning resource** for Python-specific problem solving
- A **reference** for different approaches to algorithmic challenges in Python

## Who can use it?
This repository is perfect for:
ðŸ‘¶ **Python beginners** looking for practical examples
ðŸ“ˆ **Intermediate coders** wanting to improve their problem-solving skills
ðŸ‘¨ðŸ’» **Experienced developers** interested in Python-specific optimizations

All solutions are implemented in **Python 3**, leveraging Python's unique features and standard library for efficient problem solving.
